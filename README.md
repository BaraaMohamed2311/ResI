ResI: Serverless Image Resizing Pipeline
Automatically resize images uploaded to S3 using AWS Lambda, with real-time client notifications via Socket.IO.

üîß How It Works
Upload: Images are uploaded to an S3 bucket.

Trigger: S3 event triggers a Lambda function to resize the image.

Notify: Resized image metadata is sent to the client via:

SNS (for server-side subscription confirmation).

Socket.IO (real-time frontend updates).

Render: Client displays the resized image.

‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Requirements
AWS Credentials:

The website requires AWS IAM access keys (access key ID + secret key) with permissions for:

S3 (read/write)

Lambda (invoke)

SNS (publish/subscribe)

Never expose keys client-side‚Äîuse server-side environment variables.

S3 Bucket Permissions:

Objects must be publicly accessible (public-read ACL or bucket policy) to render on the website.

Caution: Avoid exposing sensitive data; use signed URLs for production.

SNS Confirmation:

The server must confirm SNS subscription (HTTP/S endpoint) to receive Lambda completion alerts.

Socket.IO:

Ensure the client maintains a persistent connection to receive "resize complete" events.

üìù Environment Setup
AWS Services:

Configure Lambda with S3 trigger permissions.

Set up SNS topic linked to Lambda and your server endpoint.

Server:

Add all required credentials and configurations to your .env file.

Configure socket.io to listen for SNS-triggered events.
  
üîí Security Notes
AWS Keys:

Rotate keys regularly and restrict IAM policies to least-privilege access.

S3 Public Access: Use only for demo/non-sensitive data. For production:

Replace with signed URLs (e.g., via CloudFront).

Restrict Lambda to specific S3 prefixes.

SNS: Validate incoming messages using Amazon SNS message validation.

Key Features:
Real-time UX: Clients see resized images instantly via Socket.IO.

Scalable: Serverless design handles variable workloads.

üí° Reminder: All sensitive variables (AWS keys, SNS ARNs, etc.) must be stored in .env.
